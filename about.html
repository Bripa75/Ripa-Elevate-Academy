        <h1>About Brian</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm Brian, the founder of Ripa Elevate Academy. I earned my undergraduate degree in Computer Science & Information Security from John Jay College and am currently pursuing my Master's in the same field.</p>

        <p>I've tutored students from 1st grade through college, helping them succeed in reading comprehension, elementary math, and advanced college-level courses like Algebra, Pre-Calc, and Calculus I, II, III.</p>

        <p>I believe in personalized learning and step-by-step instruction to build lasting confidence. Every student learns differently, and I adapt my teaching style to match each individual's needs and learning pace.</p>

        <p>My approach combines academic rigor with patience and encouragement, creating an environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes as part of the learning process.</p>
